# Changelog

Notable changes to OPS, newest first. Format: date — what changed and why it
matters. This file starts fresh at the public release; the harness's private
prehistory is deliberately not part of it.

## 2026-07-07 — Contribution discipline

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: contributions here are typically extractions from a
  contributor's own private harness, so the extraction discipline (port
  patterns, never paste files; denylist self-scrub; run the gates) is the
  contribution gate. Includes a verbatim porting brief to hand an AI doing
  the merge.
- `main` is now PR-protected: review required, no direct pushes, no force
  pushes.

## 2026-07-07 — Initial public release

- OPS v1: foreman-by-default orchestration doctrine (P1–P15 + charter),
  git-synced file-based memory, session-survival discipline (pre-compact
  synthesis, handoff batons, post-compact re-orientation), the WORKFORCE
  fleet layer, six portable skills, two-stage deploy, and the first-launch
  `BOOTSTRAP.md` interview.
- Extracted file-by-file from a private harness with fresh git history;
  gated by an adversarial leak scan, a coherence review, a fresh-user
  cold-read audit, and the repo's own `verify-ops.sh` before the first
  commit.
